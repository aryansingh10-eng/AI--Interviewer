# AI-Interviewer
AI Interviewer is an intelligent web-based application that simulates real-world interview scenarios using voice interaction and Artificial Intelligence. The system generates technical and HR interview questions, asks them using text-to-speech, captures user responses through speech recognition, and creates a realistic interview environment for practice.

This project demonstrates the integration of AI, speech processing, and web technologies to build an interactive interview preparation platform.
